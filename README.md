# Clustering for Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning

This project explores using K-Means clustering to reduce the dimensionality of a high-dimensional sensor dataset (Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones) and compares the performance of Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers trained on full vs reduced feature sets.
